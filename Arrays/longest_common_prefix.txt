Problem Name: Longest Common Prefix

LeetCode Problem Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-common-prefix/

Problem Statement (Short):
Write a function to find the longest common prefix string amongst an array of strings.  
If there is no common prefix, return an empty string "".

Example:
Input: strs = ["flower","flow","flight"]  
Output: "fl"

Approach (Vertical Scanning):
- Compare characters of each string at the same index.
- Stop when a mismatch is found or the end of any string is reached.

Steps:
1. If the list is empty, return "".
2. Loop through each character index of the first string.
3. For each string, check if the character at the current index matches the first string.
4. If a mismatch is found or the end of a string is reached, return the prefix up to that point.
5. If no mismatch is found, return the entire first string.

Time Complexity:
- O(S), where S is the sum of all characters in all strings.

Space Complexity:
- O(1), ignoring the output.

Edge Cases:
- Empty list of strings.
- Only one string in the list.
- No common prefix.
- Some strings are empty.
